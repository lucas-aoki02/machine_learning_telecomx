# Churn Prediction Project - Telecom

This project aims to identify customers with a propensity to cancel services using Machine Learning techniques.

## 1. Model Selection and Normalization

**Selected Models:** **KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)** was chosen for being an intuitive similarity-based model that identifies patterns by comparing neighbors  **Random Forest** was selected for its high robustness and ability to handle non-linear relationships and complex interactions between variables without overfitting easily.

**Normalization Necessity:** It was essential to apply `np.log1p` and `StandardScaler` to variables like `daily_bill` and `Charges`, in addition to `MinMaxScaler` on `tenure`  **Impact on KNN:** Without this, the model would be dominated by variables with larger numerical scales, ignoring critical binary variables like `SeniorCitizen`  **Impact on Random Forest:** Although trees are scale-invariant, maintaining scaled data ensures consistency across the entire comparison pipeline.

## 2. Performance Evaluation

| Metric | KNN (k=57) | Random Forest |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Accuracy** | 0.7762 | 0.7624 |
| **Precision** | 0.6125 | 0.5465 |
| **Recall** | 0.4412 | 0.4679 |
| **F1-Score** | 0.5125 | 0.5043 |

**Confusion Matrix (Random Forest):** **True Negatives:** 932 (Correct Retention)  **False Positives:** 146 (False Alarms)  **False Negatives:** 199 (Undetected Churn)  **True Positives:** 175 (Detected Churn).

## 3. Critical Analysis and Comparison

**Which model performed best?** **KNN (k=57)** showed slightly higher accuracy and F1-score. However, **Random Forest** achieved a **higher Recall (0.467 vs 0.441)**  **Business Choice:** For Telecom, Random Forest is preferable as it identifies more customers who will actually leave, which is more valuable than raw accuracy.

**Overfitting or Underfitting?** **KNN** demonstrated stability after the  adjustment  **Random Forest** showed signs of **overfitting**, as training performance was significantly higher than test performance  **Adjustment:** To mitigate this, it is recommended to limit the tree depth (`max_depth`) or increase minimum samples per leaf.

## 4. Analysis of Relevant Variables

**Factors most influencing churn:** **1. Contract Type:** "Month-to-month" contracts have the highest proximity to the Churn profile  **2. Tenure:** The shorter the contract time, the higher the chance of churn  **3. Daily Bill:** High daily costs are a strong trigger for customer exit  **4. Payment Method:** "Electronic Check" is strongly associated with churn behavior.

## 5. Proposed Retention Strategies

**Contract Migration:** Create incentives for "Month-to-month" customers to migrate to annual plans to reduce volatility  **Early Loyalty:** Focus CS efforts on the first few months of the contract (`low tenure`), where risk is statistically higher  **Price Alert:** Monitor customers with `daily_bill` above average and offer package upgrades with better cost-benefit  **Payment Incentive:** Encourage migration from "Electronic Check" to credit cards or automatic debit.
